    <h3>About this blog</h3>

    <p>This blog is simply a website where I can test my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, as learned on <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>.</p>

    <p>Monday 1 August 2022</p>

    <p>So far I have only learned the basics of HTML. I'm about to begin learning about CSS, which I'm looking forward to.</p>
