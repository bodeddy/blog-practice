# blog-practice

The purpose of this is to help me remember everything I have learned so far on The Odin Project.

So far, I have learned the basics of HTML, Git, and Github. And so to help retain what I've learned, I'm creating a generic blog, one that I can experiment with over time as I learn new things.
